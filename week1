Game name: Mario's Soul
Game Mechanics：Souls-like Gameplay in Super Mario
Souls-like games (like Dark Souls) and sports games (like the FIFA series) are my favorite types of games, and I hope to incorporate elements of them into my course project, even though it might be highly challenging. My smart and cute teammates have discussed many mini-games, like Box Push and Plane Shooting, which are both classic and fun. My idea is to add some mechanics from Souls-like games on top of these mini-games to make the game more challenging. For example, integrating Souls-like mechanics into Super Mario, such as reducing checkpoints or setting death penalties, to increase the difficulty. The challenge of this design lies in the large content of the Super Mario game itself and how to implement the Souls-like mechanics.

游戏名：马里奥之魂
遊戲機制：魂類玩法的超級瑪麗奧
魂類遊戲（黑暗之魂）和體育遊戲（FIFA 系列）是我最喜歡的遊戲類型，我希望能將它們運用到課程項目當中，雖然這可能極具挑戰性。我聰明又可愛的組員們討論了許多小遊戲，比如推箱子和飛機射擊，它們都非常經典好玩。我的想法是在這些小遊戲的基礎上，增加魂類遊戲的部分機制，使得遊戲本身具有挑戰性。比如說在超級瑪麗奧的基礎上加入魂類遊戲的機制，比如減少檢查點、設置死亡懲罰等，以提高遊戲難度。此設計的難點在於超級瑪麗奧遊戲本身的遊戲內容較大，以及如何實現魂類遊戲的機制。
